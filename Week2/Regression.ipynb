He added it because based on his own theory of General Relativity, the universe was expanding... but that couldn't be! So he made it go away with this magical constant (OOPS!).\n",

He observed that on average, everything was moving away from us. In fact, the farther away from us the object (such as a star or galaxy) was, the faster it was moving from us!
